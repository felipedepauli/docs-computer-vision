    @  COURSE NAME
        Course:  Training YOLO v3 for Objects Detection with Custom Data

    @  SECTION
        Quick Win - Step 1: Simple Object Detection by thresholding with mask
        
    @  PROCEDURE
        1. Read RGB image.
        2. Converting to HSV.
        3. Getting Mask for blue objects.
        
    @  PS
        - This script was made using the Code Runner. The path
        to the image is relative to the root folder of the
        repository. If you are using another IDE, you may
        need to change the path to the image.

# At this point, we have a window with the original image,
# another with the image converted to the HSV color system, and another with the mask.
# Additionally, we have a window with trackbars so you can adjust the mask values.
# You can indicate which pixels with red values should appear in the mask.
# The whiter the pixel, the more intense these values are.
# The darker the pixel, the less intense they are.
# We can use it to segmentation. Got it? Good!
